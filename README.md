# Random Photo API

This page uses a GitHub Workflow to pull a random photo from Unsplash. That photo is saved, which updates the repo and triggers a build on Netlify.

The photo pull is supposed to be every 30 minutes, but GitHub makes [no assurances](https://github.community/t/no-assurance-on-scheduled-jobs/133753).
